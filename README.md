### Spotify Challenge Implementation with React and TypeScript

This repository contains my solution to the Spotify Challenge from codingchallenges.fyi, implemented using React and TypeScript. The challenge involves implementing the Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for a Spotify authentication system.
Challenge Description

The Spotify Challenge requires implementing the PKCE authentication flow for a Spotify application. This involves generating a random code verifier, deriving a code challenge, redirecting the user to the Spotify authorization page, exchanging the authorization code for an access token, and making authenticated requests to the Spotify API.
